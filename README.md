## Introduction

Emotion detection is a critical application in various fields, from human-computer interaction to sentiment analysis. This project leverages both CNN and a hybrid KNN+CNN approach to achieve accurate emotion classification. By combining traditional KNN with deep learning, we explore the potential for improved performance in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- Emotion classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- Hybrid approach combining K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and CNN for emotion detection.
- Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
- Model training, evaluation, and result analysis.
- Visualizations of accuracy and loss trends.
## Usage
-Prepare your emotion dataset or use a sample dataset.(I ue FER-2013 dataset from Karrgel)
-Preprocess the data and augment it if necessary.
-Train the CNN model using cnn_model.py.
-Implement the hybrid KNN+CNN approach using hybrid_knn_cnn.py.
-Evaluate the models and analyze the results.
-Visualize accuracy and loss trends using suitable libraries.
## Results
The CNN model achieved an accuracy of [insert CNN accuracy] on the test dataset. The hybrid KNN+CNN model demonstrated an improved accuracy of [insert hybrid model accuracy] due to the integration of traditional KNN's instance-based learning with CNN's feature extraction capabilities.
